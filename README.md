# Student-Management-System
A Student Management System by using Spring Boot Tool Suite(CRUD Operations).
CRUD stands for Create, Read/Retrieve, Update and Delete and these are the four basic operations that we perform on persistence storage.
Spring Boot is a microservice-based framework and making a production-ready application in it takes very little time.
